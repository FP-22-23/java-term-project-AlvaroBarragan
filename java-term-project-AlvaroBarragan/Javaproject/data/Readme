Proyect of the second semester(java)
Structure of the folders of the project:
/data: conatins the csv file and the readme
/src: contains 3 packages:
  auxiliary with the class player and position
  test with the test 
  types with the checkers,factory,container andthe class game 
Structure of the dataset
- a game id (int)
- a league which is an enum
- if it has been a playoffs match
- the date and time
-the patch which is a double
-the name of the first team
-the name of the second (both strings)
-A list of the characters banned by the first team
- a boolean if the first team has won
-A list of the characters banned by the second team
-and 10 players of type player
Implemented types:
Type game :
It has the following properties:
- a game id (int)
- a league which is an enum
- if it has been a playoffs match
- the date and time
-the patch which is a double
-the name of the first team
-the name of the second (both strings)
-A list of the characters banned by the first team
- a boolean if the first team has won
-A list of the characters banned by the second team
-and 10 players of type player
Constructors:
C1: Creates a game with all the baasic properties
C2: Shows a resume of a game
Restrictions:
The patch of the game has to be between 10 and 11
The size of the  list of ban as maximum can be five
The equiality criteria is that if two id of game are equal; they are equal
The compareto()method see which match has happened before(according to the pacth)
The derived property that shows if the team 2 has won (it is derived from the bool of the first team because only one can win)
Also; the getters and setters
Type Player(Auxiliary):
  name(String),
  damage(Double),
  position(enum) 
  character played(String).
  C1 Create a Player with all its basic properties
  Also; the getters and setters
 Type League(Auxiliary: Enum)
  Can take the values of:
  KeSPA,BRCC,CBLOL,CK,EM,LCK,LCS,LCL,LDL,LEC,LFL,LJL,LLA,LPL,MSC,OCS,OPL,PCS,Riot,TCL,TRA,VCS
 Type Position(Auxiliary; Enum)
  Can take the values of:
  sup,bot,mid,top,jng
 Delivery 2
 Factory
 Creates a object game according to the data provided by the csv 
 games (Container type):
 the properties are:
 games: a list of game
 Constructors:
  C1 : a constructor which creates an empty object games 
  C2: A constructor that creates a object games with the object game contained in a stream
  Equality criteria:
  Two games are equal if all the objects they contain are equal
  Functions to add (one game or a list of game) and subtract a game from an object games 
  
  Other functions:
   "getNumberGames" returns the total numbers of games played on the season
   "exists" returns false if there is a list of banned characters bigger than 6
    - existsstr do the same but using streams (Delivery3)
   "total dmg" calculates the total damage done in that season
    - totaldmgstr do the same but using streams (Delivery3)
   "select league" returns all the games played on a given certain league
    -selectleaguestr do the same but using streams (Delivery3)
   "champof player" return a set of all champions played by a given player
   "freqof match" return a map with the number of games played in each patch.
    -freqofmatchstr do the same using streams (Delivery3)
    
   Delivery3
   Adding functions  to the container type(each one has to be done with streams):
    "leaguesin patch" retruns a sorted set of the leagues played in a given patch
    "bestgameofsup" returns a Map the name of each support of the first team as the key with their maximum damage on a game during the season as the value
