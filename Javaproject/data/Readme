The object game has the following properties:
- a game id (int)
- a league which is an enum
- if it has been a playoffs match
- the date and time
-the patch which is a double
-the name of the first team
-the name of the second (both strings)
-A list of the characters banned by the first team
- a boolean if the first team has won
-A list of the characters banned by the second team
-and 10 players which are object of and auxiliary type that has the properties name, damage per minute,position(another enum) and the character played.
Then, in the class game, we have the function .equals what compares the ids of two matches to see if they are equals
Also, a compareto to see which match has happened before (comparing the patch)
Then, methods to add champions to the ban list with the restriction of a maximum of five elements.
In addition, the getters and setters and a derived property that shows if the team 2 has won (it is derived from the bool of the first team because only one can win)
Then two constructos, one to show in a string the complete information of a match and other to show a resume
Finally, the other restriction is that every game has to be played between the patch 10 and 11 (what is a season in the real world)
